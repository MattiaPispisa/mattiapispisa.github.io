          Splitting the view from the controller is foundational to build great
          applications. We tend to rely on external libraries to manage their
          state. But React itself has a great off-the-shelf state management
          tool: the useReducer. In this talk weâ€™re going to get to know more
          about it, and especially learn how to enhance it tailoring it to our
          needs. You'll discover what you have been missing.
